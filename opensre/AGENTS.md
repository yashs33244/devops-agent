## Tracer Development Reference

## Build and Run commands

- Build `make install` (sets up the project environment via `uv sync` and installs this repo in editable mode)
- Run **`uv run opensre …`** from the repo root while developing — preferred approach, uses this checkout even if another `opensre` is on your `PATH`.
- Use **`uv run python …`** for any Python commands.

## Lint & Format

- Lint: `make lint` (or fix: `ruff check app/ tests/ --fix`)
- Format check: `make format-check`
- Auto-format locally: `make format`
- Type check: `make typecheck`
- One-shot quality gate: `make check`

## Testing

- Test: `make test-cov`
- Test real alerts: `make test-rca`

## Code Style

- Use strict typing, follow DRY principle
- One clear purpose per file (separation of concerns)

### Before Push

Before any push or PR creation, follow the mandatory checklist in [CI.md](CI.md).

- `CI.md` is the source of truth for push/PR readiness.
- Do not skip required checks.

`app/` one level deeper:

- `app/analytics/` — Analytics event plumbing and install helpers used by the onboarding flow.
- `app/auth/` — JWT and authentication helpers for local and hosted runtime access.
- `app/cli/` — Command-line interface, onboarding wizard, local LLM helpers, and CLI tests support. Interactive terminal (TTY) loop: `app/cli/interactive_shell/`. REPL watchdog slash commands (`/watch`, `/watches`, `/unwatch`): PR demo steps live under **Interactive shell: REPL watchdog demo** in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#interactive-shell-repl-watchdog-demo).
- `app/constants/` — Shared prompt and other static constants.
- `app/deployment/` — Single home for “deployment” code, split by concern:
    - `app/deployment/methods/` — _How_ you ship (Railway CLI, etc.).
    - `app/deployment/operations/` — _Runtime / infra_ around a deployment (health polling, EC2 output files, provider dry-run validation).
- `app/entrypoints/` — SDK and MCP entrypoints exposed to external runtimes.
- `app/guardrails/` — Guardrail rules, evaluation engine, audit helpers, and CLI bindings.
- `app/integrations/` — Integration config normalization, verification, selectors, store, and catalog logic.
- `app/integrations/llm_cli/` — Subprocess-backed LLM CLIs (e.g. Codex). Extension guide: `app/integrations/llm_cli/AGENTS.md`.
- `app/masking/` — Masking utilities for redacting or normalizing sensitive content.
- `app/pipeline/` — Investigation orchestration and runner helpers (`run_investigation`, `run_chat`).
- `app/remote/` — Remote-hosted runtime operations and integration points.
- `app/sandbox/` — Sandboxed execution helpers for controlled runtime actions.
- `app/services/` — Reusable clients and adapters for integrations/tools. LLM APIs: `app/services/AGENTS.md`.
- `app/state/` — Shared agent and investigation state models plus state factories.
- `app/tools/` — Tool registry, decorator, base classes, per-tool packages, shared utilities, and registry helpers.
- `app/types/` — Shared typed contracts for evidence, retrieval, and tool-related payloads.
- `app/utils/` — Cross-cutting utility helpers used across the app and test harnesses.
- `app/watch_dog/` — Watchdog feature: per-threshold Telegram alarm dispatch with cooldown, sitting on top of `app/utils/telegram_delivery.py`.
- `app/webapp.py` — Web-facing application entrypoint; the `opensre` CLI is `app/cli/__main__.py`.

`tests/` is organized by capability boundary rather than by framework:

- `tests/tools/` — Tool behavior, registry, and helper coverage.
- `tests/integrations/` — Integration config, verification, store, selector, and client tests.
- `tests/e2e/` — Live end-to-end scenarios against real services and infrastructure.
- `tests/synthetic/` — Fixture-driven synthetic RCA scenarios with no live infrastructure.
- `tests/deployment/` — Deployment validation and infrastructure lifecycle tests.
- `tests/chaos_engineering/` — Chaos lab and experiment orchestration tests and assets.
- `tests/cli/` — CLI-specific behavior, smoke tests, and command wiring.
- `tests/utils/` — Shared test utilities, fixtures, and local helpers.
- `tests/nodes/`, `tests/services/`, `tests/remote/`, `tests/sandbox/`, `tests/guardrails/`, `tests/entrypoints/` — Feature-specific coverage for the corresponding app layers.

## 2. Entry Points

### Adding a Tool

The tool registry auto-discovers modules under `app/tools/`, so the normal path is to add one module or package there and let discovery pick it up.

Files to touch:

- `app/tools/<ToolName>/__init__.py` for the tool implementation, or `app/tools/<tool_file>.py` for a lighter-weight function tool.
- `app/tools/utils/` if the tool needs shared helper code.
- `app/services/<vendor>/client.py` if the tool should reuse a dedicated API client instead of inlining requests.
- `docs/<tool_name>.mdx` for user-facing usage, parameters, and examples.
- `tests/tools/test_<tool_name>.py` for behavior and regression coverage.

Steps:

1. Pick the simplest shape that fits the tool. Use a `BaseTool` subclass for richer behavior; use `@tool(...)` from `app.tools.tool_decorator` for a lightweight function tool.
2. Declare clear metadata: `name`, `description`, `source`, `input_schema`, and any `use_cases`, `requires`, `outputs`, or `retrieval_controls` you need.
3. Keep the tool self-contained. Put reusable transport or parsing code in `app/services/` or `app/tools/utils/` rather than copying it into the tool body.
4. If the tool should appear in both investigation and chat surfaces, set `surfaces=("investigation", "chat")`.
5. Add tests that cover schema shape, availability, extraction, and the runtime behavior that the planner depends on.

### Changing the investigation pipeline

Investigations are coordinated in `app/pipeline/pipeline.py` and exposed via
`app/pipeline/runners.py`. Agent logic lives under `app/agent/`; publishing
under `app/delivery/`.

Files to touch:

- `app/pipeline/pipeline.py` for high-level stage ordering.
- `app/agent/` for extract, context, investigation, or chat behavior.
- `app/state/*.py` when adding or renaming persisted investigation fields.
- `docs/` — update or add a page if the change introduces user-visible behavior or configuration.
- `tests/` coverage for the affected CLI, synthetic, or integration paths.

Steps:

1. Keep each stage focused on one responsibility.
2. Extend state models when new fields cross stage boundaries.
3. Update tests that exercise `run_investigation` / streaming entry points.

### Adding an Integration

Integration work usually spans config normalization, verification, service clients, tools, docs, and tests.

Files to touch:

- `app/integrations/<name>.py` for config builders, validators, selectors, and normalization helpers.
- `app/integrations/catalog.py` when the new integration must be resolved into the shared runtime config.
- `app/integrations/verify.py` when the integration needs a local verification path.
- `app/services/<name>/client.py` when the integration needs a dedicated API client.
- `app/tools/<Name>Tool/` or `app/tools/<tool_file>.py` for the user-facing tool layer.
- `docs/<name>.mdx` for user-facing setup, usage, and verification docs.
- `tests/integrations/test_<name>.py` for config, verification, and store coverage.
- `tests/tools/test_<tool_name>.py` and any relevant `tests/e2e/` or `tests/synthetic/` files if the integration is exercised by tools or scenarios.

Examples from the repo:

- Datadog: `app/services/datadog/client.py`, `app/integrations/catalog.py`, `app/integrations/verify.py`, `app/tools/DataDog*`, and `tests/integrations/test_verify.py`.
- Grafana: `app/integrations/catalog.py`, `app/integrations/verify.py`, `app/tools/Grafana*`, `app/cli/wizard/local_grafana_stack/`, and the Grafana-related tests under `tests/integrations/`.

Basic steps:

1. Add the integration config and normalization logic first so the rest of the stack can consume a consistent shape.
2. Add or update the service client only when the integration needs direct remote calls.
3. Wire the tool layer after the config path is stable.
4. Add docs and tests together so the integration is understandable and verifiable.
5. Run `make verify-integrations` before treating the integration as complete.

## 3. Rules (if X -> do Y)

- If core agent or pipeline logic changes -> run `make test-cov` and `make typecheck`.
- If a new feature is shipped (tool, CLI command, pipeline behavior, integration) -> add a `docs/` page or section covering usage, configuration, and examples before the PR is opened.
- If an existing feature changes behavior, flags, or config shape -> update the relevant `docs/` page in the same PR; docs and code must stay in sync.
- If a tool's API or schema changes -> update docs in `docs/` and update the related unit tests, usually under `tests/tools/`.
- If an integration changes -> update `tests/integrations/` and verify with `make verify-integrations`.
- If adding a new integration -> follow the New Integration Checklist below before opening the PR for review.
- If adding new tests -> always place them in `tests/`, never in `app/` (no inline tests).
- If CI-only tests are added -> mark them with the right pytest marker or place them in the appropriate e2e/synthetic/chaos folder so they do not run in the default local suite.
- If investigation branching or loop behavior changes -> update `app/pipeline/pipeline.py` and the tests for that path.
- If pushing or creating a PR -> follow the full pre-push checklist in [CI.md](CI.md).

## 4. Testing

### Commands

- Unit tests: `make test-cov`
- Integration tests: `make verify-integrations`
- E2E tests: `make test-rca` or `make test-full`
- Synthetic (no live infra): `make test-synthetic`
- Single RCA test: `make test-rca FILE=<name>`
- Lint: `make lint`
- Type check: `make typecheck`

### Fast Local Testing

The fastest local loop is `make test-cov`, which exercises the non-live unit suite and skips the heavier live-infra paths. When you need a specific RCA scenario, use `make test-rca FILE=<fixture>` with one of the bundled alert fixtures under `tests/e2e/rca/`.

## 5. Footguns (common mistakes to avoid)

- Vendored deps: No obvious vendored third-party dependencies are present. Python dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml`, and the docs site has its own `docs/package.json` and `docs/pnpm-lock.yaml`. Do not vendor new libraries unless there is a strong reason.
- Secrets: Never commit `.env` - always use `.env.example` as the template. Use read-only credentials for production integrations.
- CI-only tests: Some e2e tests, including Kubernetes, EKS, and chaos engineering paths, require live infrastructure and are excluded from `make test-cov`. Do not expect them to pass locally without that environment.
- Legacy graph dev server: removed; use `make dev` for a local uvicorn hint or run investigations via the CLI.
- Docker requirement: Several targets, including the Grafana local stack and Chaos Mesh workflows, require a running Docker daemon.

## 6. New Integration Checklist

When adding a new integration, a PR is only ready when:

- Integration code added under `app/integrations/<name>/`

- Docs added under `docs/`
- Screenshot or demo GIF showing the integration working
- E2E or synthetic test added
- `make verify-integrations` passes
- `make lint` and `make typecheck` pass
