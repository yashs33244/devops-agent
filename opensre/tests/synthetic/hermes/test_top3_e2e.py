"""End-to-end tests for the top-3 Hermes operational issues.

These exercise the **full** runtime stack — ``FileTailer`` polling a
real file on disk, the classifier reacting to lines as they're
appended, and the ``TelegramSink`` formatting + dispatching via a
patched ``AlarmDispatcher``. Unlike ``test_suite.py`` (which feeds
lines to the classifier directly) and ``test_telegram_dispatch.py``
(which uses ``agent.process`` for synchronous classification), this
suite drives the daemon thread through ``HermesAgent.start()`` and
asserts behaviour against the live tailer.

The three scenarios covered here correspond to the top operational
issues surfaced in the Hermes Agent issue tracker:

1. ``001-gateway-auth-bypass-after-restart`` (#23778, P0 security)
2. ``002-gateway-systemd-crash-loop`` (gateway troubleshooting)
3. ``003-state-db-wal-unbounded-growth`` (#24034)
