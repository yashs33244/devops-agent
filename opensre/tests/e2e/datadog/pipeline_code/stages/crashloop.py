"""Crashloop stage: simulates a container OOMKilled by the kernel (exit 137).

This stage mimics a genomics alignment worker that runs out of memory while
loading a large reference genome index into RAM.  Kubernetes sees exit=137
(SIGKILL), marks the container as OOMKilled, and retries via backoffLimit →
BackoffLimitExceeded / CrashLoopBackOff visible in kubectl describe.
