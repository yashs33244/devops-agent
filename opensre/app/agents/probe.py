"""Per-PID process helpers for the monitor-local-agents fleet view.

Pure collectors: no background loop, no caching, no UI wiring. The
wiring layer (#1490) batches calls in a REPL background task; the
registry layer (#1487) decides which PIDs to ask about.

The acceptance criterion for the parent issue (#1489) requires that
``psutil`` stay confined to this module so the dependency surface
remains explicit. ``app/agents/__init__.py`` reaches into here only via
