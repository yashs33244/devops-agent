        The previous single-pass ``seen_end`` walk processed matches right-to-left
        and skipped any match whose end exceeded the cursor, so a wider match
        overlapping (or containing) an already-redacted narrower match would
        leave its prefix/suffix unredacted — e.g. with rules matching
        ``super_secret_token_value`` and ``secret_token`` on the same text, the
        ``super_`` and ``_value`` bookends survived in the output.

        Algorithm:
        1. Sort redact matches by ``(start ASC, -end)`` so ties at the same
           starting offset put the widest match first.
        2. Sweep left-to-right, merging any match whose ``start`` falls before
           the current interval's ``end``. The representative rule for the
           merged interval is whichever contributing match had the largest
           ``source_width`` (its individual ``end - start`` before any merging
           — *not* the merged span's width). This preserves the existing
           "longest-keyword-wins" behaviour for same-start overlaps and
           extends it to contained and partially-overlapping spans.
        3. Apply replacements right-to-left over the merged intervals so string
           indices remain valid as each redaction resizes the output.
