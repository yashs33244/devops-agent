"""Shared incident time window for the investigation pipeline.

The agent runs many time-aware tools (log queries, metrics, deploy commit
listings, etc.). Today each tool independently picks a default time range
("last 60 minutes") counted from the agent's wall clock. Two problems
follow.

1. The agent's wall clock is not the same as when the incident actually
   started. An alert that fired three hours before the agent ran will be
   completely outside any "last 60 minutes" query.

2. Different tools default to different ranges, so two tools investigating
   the same incident answer questions about different windows.

This module introduces a single ``IncidentWindow`` value object owned by
``AgentState`` and populated from the alert's own timestamps in the
``extract_alert`` step. Once tools start reading from it (deferred to a
follow-up PR) every time-aware tool will agree on the same window.

This file is pure foundation. It does not change any tool's behavior. It
just exposes the resolver, the value object, and the anchor parsers for
the five alert formats the agent receives today.

Window semantics: the window is half-open: ``[since, until)``. Evidence
timestamped exactly at ``since`` is included; evidence at ``until`` is
not. This matches the usual half-open convention used by Datadog,
Grafana, and Loki time-range queries.

All datetimes are timezone-aware and normalised to UTC. Naive timestamps
encountered during parsing are silently treated as UTC. Construction of
``IncidentWindow`` will reject naive inputs to prevent accidental
silent bugs in caller code.
