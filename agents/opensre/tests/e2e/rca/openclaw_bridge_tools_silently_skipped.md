# Alert: [FIRING:1] OpenClaw Bridge Tools Never Selected — connection_verified Bug

<!--
  RCA test file — parsed by tests/e2e/rca/run_rca_test.py
  Run via: make test-rca FILE=openclaw_bridge_tools_silently_skipped

  Scenario: OpenClaw is correctly configured and connected. The gateway is running,
  the token is valid, `opensre integrations verify openclaw` passes. Yet during
  every investigation the planner never selects list_openclaw_tools,
  search_openclaw_conversations, or call_openclaw_bridge_tool. Engineers notice
  that OpenClaw conversation context is never used even for services that have
  recent conversation history.

  Root cause (Bug 1 from integration plan):
    _catalog_impl.py returns openclaw_config.model_dump() without injecting
    connection_verified=True. _openclaw_available() reads
    sources["openclaw"]["connection_verified"] which is absent, so all three
    bridge tools report is_available=False permanently.

  To reproduce:
    1. Configure openclaw: export OPENCLAW_MCP_MODE=stdio
       export OPENCLAW_MCP_COMMAND=openclaw
       export OPENCLAW_MCP_ARGS="mcp serve"
    2. Verify passes: opensre integrations verify openclaw  → "discovered N tool(s)"
    3. Run investigation: opensre investigate -i tests/fixtures/openclaw_test_alert.json
    4. Check verbose output: none of the three bridge tools appear in planned_actions
    5. This alert fires when monitoring detects openclaw_tools_selected_total == 0
       across multiple investigations where openclaw was configured.

## Message
**Firing**

OpenClaw is configured and `opensre integrations verify openclaw` returns success, but
the investigation planner has not selected any OpenClaw bridge tool across the last 47
investigations. The tools `list_openclaw_tools`, `search_openclaw_conversations`, and
`call_openclaw_bridge_tool` all report `is_available=False` despite a valid connection.

This is caused by Bug 1 in the OpenClaw catalog classifier:
`app/integrations/_catalog_impl.py` returns `openclaw_config.model_dump()` without
injecting `connection_verified=True`. The `_openclaw_available()` gate reads
`sources["openclaw"]["connection_verified"]` which is never set, so
`is_available()` always returns `False`.

Labels:
- alertname = OpenClawBridgeToolsNeverSelected
- severity = high
- service = opensre-planner
- environment = production
- pipeline_name = openclaw_mcp

Annotations:
- affected_tools = list_openclaw_tools, search_openclaw_conversations, call_openclaw_bridge_tool
- root_cause_file = app/integrations/_catalog_impl.py
- bug = connection_verified key missing from catalog-resolved openclaw config dict

The following script confirms whether the bug is present:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check_connection_verified_bug.sh — verify Bug 1 is fixed
set -euo pipefail

echo "[check] Testing connection_verified injection in catalog classifier..."
