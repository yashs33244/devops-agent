"""Synthetic end-to-end test: HermesAgent → TelegramSink → AlarmDispatcher.

Distinct from ``test_suite.py``, which only exercises the classifier.
This test feeds a realistic ``errors.log`` slice through the full
incident pipeline and asserts that the Telegram dispatcher receives a
correctly-formatted message for each detected incident, with
fingerprint-keyed dedup applied across repeats.

The log fixture is synthesized inline rather than read from disk so the
test does not depend on the per-scenario ``errors.log`` files (those
are ``.gitignore``d).
