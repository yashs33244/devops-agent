1. ETL (Extract Transform Load): Data extracted from source, transformed/denormalized,

   - Preprocessing for ML or business intelligence
   - Computing aggregations (counting events in time intervals)
   - Calculating billing reports
   - Indexing pipelines

2. Data Analytics/Business Intelligence: Aggregating data across users/devices to
   identify issues or successes. Key characteristics:
   - Monthly/daily aggregate reports
   - Cross-source data joins
   - Triggered by new data arrival

3. Machine Learning Pipelines: Multi-stage process including:
   - Feature/label extraction from larger dataset
   - Model training on extracted features
   - Model evaluation on test set

Most pipeline data freshness SLOs use one of these formats:
- X% of data processed in Y [seconds, days, minutes]
- The oldest data is no older than Y [seconds, days, minutes]
- Pipeline job completed successfully within Y [seconds, days, minutes]

Key Principles:
1. Measure end-to-end, not per-stage - customers care about total latency
2. Timeliness measured as delay from when bucket could theoretically close
3. Downstream jobs can't start until dependencies are delivered
4. Any delay in delivery affects downstream job timeliness

Correctness Targets:
- Use test accounts to calculate expected output ("golden data")
- Compare expected vs actual output
- Monitor for errors/discrepancies with threshold-based alerting
- Backward-looking analysis (e.g., no more than 0.1% incorrect invoices/quarter)

Skewness: Maximal percentage of data misplaced on daily basis
- Occurs when heuristics place events in wrong time buckets
- Can cause under-reporting then over-reporting for time periods

Completeness: Percentage of events delivered after successful publishing
- Compare counts of published vs delivered events

Causes of Delayed Data:
1. Input/output is delayed from upstream
2. Downstream job starts without necessary data
3. Pipeline stalls waiting for dependencies
4. Hanging chunks - work units requiring disproportionate resources

Impact:
- Stale data is almost always better than incorrect data
- If pipeline processes incomplete data, errors propagate downstream
- Data dependencies must be respected by all stages

"Hanging Chunk" Problem:
- Some chunks require uneven resources (e.g., large customer data)
- End-to-end runtime capped to worst-case chunk performance
- Killing hung job wastes all previous work (no checkpointing)

Batch Scheduling Delays:
- Lower-priority batch jobs experience startup delays
- Excessive batch scheduler use risks preemptions

If single region serving corrupt data:
- Drain serving/processing jobs from affected region

Definition: Resource becomes overloaded from excessive access, causing failures.

Common Examples:

- CPU exhaustion from concurrent access to data on one machine
- Row-level lock contention in databases
- Concurrent hard drive access exceeding physical limits
- Single large work unit consuming disproportionate resources

Mitigation Strategies:
1. Block fine-grained data (individual records) to let rest of pipeline progress
2. Dynamic rebalancing - break large work into smaller pieces
3. Build emergency shutdown into client logic
4. Skip problematic input data via flag/config
5. Restructure data/access patterns to spread load evenly
6. Reduce lock granularity to avoid contention

Definition: For each cycle of large periodic pipeline, potentially thousands of
workers immediately start work, overwhelming:
- Servers running the workers
- Underlying shared cluster services
- Networking infrastructure

Compounding Factors:
- Missing retry logic: Work dropped on failure, job not retried
- Naive retry logic: Retry on failure compounds the problem
- Human intervention: Adding more workers when job doesn't complete

Result: Nothing harder on cluster infrastructure than a buggy 10,000 worker job.

Prevention:
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Rate limit worker startup
- Use circuit breakers for dependent services

Standard Model Issues:
- Metrics collected during execution, reported only on completion
- If job fails, no statistics provided
- Real-time data important for operational support and emergency response

Continuous vs Periodic:
- Continuous pipelines have tasks constantly running with real-time metrics
- Periodic pipelines often lack real-time monitoring by design

Required Monitoring:
1. Number of work units in various completion stages
2. Latency and aging information for each stage
3. Throttling and pushback rationale
4. Resource usage limiting factors
5. Worker machine state distribution
6. Failing, stuck, or slow work unit counts
7. Historical run statistics

End-to-End Measurement:
- Don't just measure per-stage SLOs
- Per-stage monitoring misses customer experience
- Can miss end-to-end data corruption bugs

Key Principle: Don't overdepend on SLOs/SLAs of other products.

Steps:
1. Identify third-party dependencies
2. Design for largest failure in their advertised SLAs
3. Example: If single-region uptime guarantee insufficient, replicate across regions

When Dependencies Break SLAs:
- Can negatively impact dependent pipelines
- If you depend on stricter guarantees than advertised, you fail within their SLA
- May need to accept lower reliability and offer looser SLA to customers

Google DiRT (Disaster Recovery Testing):

- Simulate regional outages

Immediate Response:
1. Mitigate impact - prevent further bad data entering system

3. Drain affected region if regional issue

Data Restoration:
- Restore from previously known good version
- Reprocess to repair data
- Consider selective reprocessing (only impacted users/accounts)
- Use intermediate checkpoints to avoid full end-to-end reprocess

For Incompleteness: Redeliver events from last known-good checkpoint
For Excessive Skewness: Reshuffle events to correct hourly buckets

Post-Recovery:
- Strongly advise customers to reprocess their downstream data
- Document recovery steps taken
- Update runbooks with lessons learned

- Tie code changes to releases for fast rollbacks
- Have tested backup/restore procedures
- Ensure easy region draining capability""",

Autoscaling Benefits:
- Handle workload spikes without manual intervention
- Don't provision for peak load 100% of time
- Turn down idle workers to save costs
- Critical for streaming pipelines and variable workloads

Capacity Planning:
- Predict future growth and allocate accordingly
- Weigh resource cost vs engineering effort for efficiency
- Consider: storage costs, network bandwidth, cross-region replication
- Periodically examine dataset and prune unused content

Resource Measurement:
- Measure efficiency at each individual stage (not just end-to-end SLO)
- Track which jobs responsible for resource usage increases
- Focus engineering effort on high-usage jobs

Autoscaler Pitfalls:
- Requires strong correlation between CPU and work performed
- Can scale indefinitely if CPU-work correlation breaks
- Limit maximum instances Autoscaler can use
- Restrict CPU usage of daemons on instances
- Throttle CPU when no useful work being done""",

Use playbooks as a deterministic incident flow:
1. Classify symptom: latency, error rate, saturation, or deployment regression.
2. Confirm scope/blast radius: single service, shared dependency, or platform-wide.
3. Collect high-signal telemetry first: metrics + logs + alert-rule context.
4. Verify one root-cause mechanism before remediation to avoid red-herring fixes.
5. Record a short evidence-backed causal chain in the incident timeline.

Suggested playbook structure:
- Preconditions: required integrations, identifiers, and permissions.
- Trigger patterns: alert names, thresholds, and example symptom signatures.
- Investigation sequence: ordered checks with stop conditions.
- Decision points: clear branch logic (if X then Y).
- First-response remediation: reversible, low-risk mitigations first.
- Escalation criteria: when to involve DB, platform, or application owners.
- Validation and rollback: how to confirm recovery and revert safely.
- Post-incident follow-up: prevention action items and ownership.

- Controller: Optional component for auxiliary activities

Workflow Correctness Guarantees:
1. Configuration tasks create barriers for work
2. All committed work requires valid lease held by worker
3. Output files uniquely named by workers
4. Client/server validate Task Master via server token

Benefits over Periodic Pipelines:
- Strong guarantees about job completion
- Global consistency via distributed storage
- Automatic failover between regions
- No undefined state on failures

When to Use Continuous vs Periodic:
- If problem is continuous or will grow to be continuous, use continuous
- Periodic pipelines are fragile under organic growth
- Continuous provides better scaling and reliability""",
