"""Local-host pub/sub bus for cross-agent findings over a Unix-domain socket.

Carries the same shape as ``app/state/agent_state.py``'s ``evidence`` records so
findings published by one agent (claude-code, cursor, aider, ...) can later be
lifted into ``AgentState.evidence`` without re-mapping fields. See
``docs/agents.mdx`` for the on-the-wire schema.

Topology is a self-electing broker: the first ``publish`` or ``subscribe`` call
that finds no live socket binds it and runs an in-process daemon thread that
fans incoming JSONL messages out to every connected subscriber. Other processes
attach as plain clients. If the broker dies, the next operation re-elects.

    observe ``_socket_is_live`` → False can race through ``_unlink_stale`` +
    ``bind``: the kernel guarantees one bind succeeds, but the loser is left
    holding a listener fd whose filesystem path the winner just took, plus
    the accept/reader daemon threads it spawned — a real resource leak that
    persists for the loser's process lifetime. Where ``flock`` is available,
    holding it around the
    check-then-bind sequence makes election atomic across processes.

    A lost bind race (``EADDRINUSE`` / ``EEXIST``) is still converted to
    ``None`` defensively — flock is best-effort on exotic filesystems. Any
    other ``OSError`` from ``start()`` (e.g. PID-file write failure) is
    propagated — those are real errors users need to see, not bus splits to
    paper over silently.
