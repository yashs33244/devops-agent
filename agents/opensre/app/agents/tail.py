"""Live stdout tail for the monitor-local-agents fleet view.

Backs the ``/agents trace <pid>`` slash command. The attach path only
accepts *regular files* backing fd 1 of the target pid: TTY/PTY/pipe/
socket/anon_inode targets are rejected at attach time with a precise
error so we never compete with the legitimate consumer for bytes.
PTY interception for OpenSRE-spawned agents is left to a future change
once a spawn path lands.

Layered bounding (per the 4 MiB acceptance criterion):
    * the reader thread publishes into a ``queue.Queue`` with a fixed
      ``maxsize``; on overflow the oldest chunk is dropped so the
      stream stays fresh under burst writers
    * :class:`TailBuffer` caps the *consumer-side* accumulator at
      ``DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES`` and drops whole chunks from the head so the
      UTF-8 decode boundary in :meth:`TailBuffer.decoded` always sits
      between chunks (no mid-codepoint splits)
