"""File-write conflict detection and rendering for `/agents conflicts`.

Detection is pure logic over a list of write events. Whatever upstream component
(a watcher; eventually #1500's blast-radius watcher, or a polling collector)
produces these events is out of scope for this module — we accept events as
input and treat collection as somebody else's problem.
