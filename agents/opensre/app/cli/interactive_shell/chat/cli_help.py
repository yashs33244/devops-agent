"""Documentation-aware procedural answers for the OpenSRE interactive shell.

When the router classifies an input as a procedural / how-to question we land
here. We retrieve the most relevant pages from the project ``docs/`` directory
and combine them with the CLI ``--help`` reference so the LLM answers from
maintained documentation rather than model memory.

The matching ``answer_cli_agent`` path remains available for free-form
terminal chat that may invoke runtime actions; this module is the strict
docs-grounded surface and never executes actions.
