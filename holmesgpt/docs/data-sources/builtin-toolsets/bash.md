# Bash Toolset

!!! info "Enabled by Default"
    This toolset is enabled by default and should typically remain enabled.

The bash toolset allows Holmes to execute shell commands for troubleshooting and system analysis. Commands are validated against configurable allow/deny lists before execution.

## Configuration

=== "Holmes CLI"

    Add the following to **~/.holmes/config.yaml**. Create the file if it doesn't exist:

    ```yaml
    toolsets:
      bash:
        enabled: true
        config:
          builtin_allowlist: "core"  # "none", "core", or "extended"
          allow:                     # additional prefixes (merged with builtins)
            - "my-custom-tool"
          deny:
            - "kubectl get secret"
            - "kubectl describe secret"
    ```

    Approved commands are saved to `~/.holmes/bash_approved_prefixes.yaml` and persist across sessions.

    **CLI Flags:**

    | Flag | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | `--bash-always-deny` | Automatically deny commands not in the allow list |
    | `--bash-always-allow` | Automatically approve all commands (use with caution) |

=== "Robusta Helm Chart"

    ```yaml
    holmes:
      toolsets:
        bash:
          enabled: true
          config:
            builtin_allowlist: "extended"
            allow:
              - "my-custom-command"
            deny:
              - "kubectl get secret"
    ```

    `extended` is recommended for Helm deployments where Holmes runs in a container with a minimal filesystem.

## Builtin Allowlist Levels

The `builtin_allowlist` field controls which commands are pre-approved:

**`core`** (CLI default) - safe on local machines and containers:

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| Kubernetes | `kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, `kubectl logs`, `kubectl top`, `kubectl explain`, `kubectl api-resources`, `kubectl config view`, `kubectl config current-context`, `kubectl cluster-info`, `kubectl version`, `kubectl auth can-i`, `kubectl diff`, `kubectl events` |
| JSON | `jq` |
| Text processing | `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `cut`, `tr` |
| System info | `id`, `whoami`, `hostname`, `uname`, `date`, `which`, `type` |

**`extended`** (Helm default) - adds these on top of `core`:

| Category | Commands | Why container-only |
|----------|----------|--------------------|
| File reading | `cat`, `echo`, `base64` | Can read sensitive files (~/.ssh, ~/.aws) on local machines |
| Filesystem | `ls`, `find`, `stat`, `du`, `df` | Exposes local filesystem structure |
| Archives | `tar -tf`, `gzip -l`, `zcat`, `zgrep` | Can inspect local archives |

**`none`** - empty builtin list. Only commands in your `allow` list and previously approved commands are allowed.

User-provided `allow` and `deny` entries are always merged with the selected builtin level.

## Command Approval

When Holmes tries to run a command not in your allow list, you'll see a prompt:

```text
Bash command

  kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3
  Scale nginx deployment to 3 replicas

Do you want to proceed?
  1. Yes
  2. Yes, and don't ask again for `kubectl scale deployment nginx` commands
  3. Type here to tell Holmes what to do differently
```

- **Option 1**: Run this command once
- **Option 2**: Run and add the prefix to your allow list (saved to `~/.holmes/bash_approved_prefixes.yaml`)
- **Option 3**: Reject and provide feedback to Holmes

## Prefix Matching

Commands are matched by prefix. For example, if `kubectl get` is in your allow list:

| Command | Allowed? |
|---------|----------|
| `kubectl get pods` | Yes |
| `kubectl get pods -n production` | Yes |
| `kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces` | Yes |
| `kubectl delete pod my-pod` | No (different subcommand) |

For piped commands, each segment is checked:

```bash
kubectl get pods | grep error | head -10
```

This requires `kubectl get`, `grep`, and `head` to all be allowed.

## Large Tool Result Storage

When a tool response exceeds the LLM context window limit, Holmes saves the result to disk and gives the LLM a file path. The bash toolset automatically allows read-only commands (`cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `jq`) on the storage directory so the LLM can access saved results without approval prompts.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HOLMES_TOOL_RESULT_STORAGE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable saving large results to disk. When disabled, oversized results are dropped and the LLM is asked to retry with a narrower query. |
| `HOLMES_TOOL_RESULT_STORAGE_PATH` | `/tmp/.holmes` | Directory for saved results. Auto-cleaned per session. |

```bash
# Disable filesystem storage entirely
export HOLMES_TOOL_RESULT_STORAGE_ENABLED=false
```

See [Environment Variables](../../reference/environment-variables.md#tool-result-size-limits) for the full list of size-limit settings.

## Blocked Commands

The following are always blocked and cannot be overridden:

- `sudo` and `su`
- Subshells: `$(...)`, backticks, `<(...)`, `>(...)`

## Tools
