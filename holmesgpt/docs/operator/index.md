# Holmes Operator - Overview & Installation

Most AI agents are great at troubleshooting problems, but still need a human to notice something is wrong and trigger an investigation. Operator mode fixes that — HolmesGPT runs in the background 24/7, spots problems before your customers notice, and messages you in Slack with the fix.

Under the hood, it uses Kubernetes CRDs to declaratively define one-time and scheduled health checks. While the operator itself runs in Kubernetes, **health checks can query any data source Holmes is connected to** — VMs, cloud services, databases, SaaS platforms, and more. If you've [connected a data source](../data-sources/builtin-toolsets/index.md), operator checks can query it.

!!! tip "Recommended: Connect the GitHub integration"

    Connect the [GitHub MCP server](../data-sources/builtin-toolsets/github-mcp.md) so Holmes can open PRs to fix the problems it finds — not just report them.

!!! warning "Holmes Operator - Alpha Release"

    **Important Considerations:**

    - **Status**: Holmes Operator is in **alpha** and subject to breaking changes
    - **AI Usage Costs**: Each health check triggers an LLM call (at least 1). Schedule checks cautiously to manage costs
    - **Recommendation**: Begin with infrequent schedules (e.g., hourly or daily) and monitor usage before scaling up

## Features

- **[Deployment Verification](deployment-verification.md)**: Deploy a HealthCheck alongside your app to verify the new version is healthy — and gate CI/CD on the result
- **[One-time Health Checks](health-checks.md)**: Create `HealthCheck` resources that run immediately and report results
- **[Scheduled Health Checks](scheduled-health-checks.md)**: Create `ScheduledHealthCheck` resources that run on cron schedules for continuous monitoring
- **Not just Kubernetes**: Health checks can query any connected data source — Prometheus, Datadog, AWS, databases, and [more](../data-sources/builtin-toolsets/index.md)
- **Kubernetes-native**: Uses standard CRDs with kubectl support
- **Status Tracking**: Full execution history and results stored in resource status
- **Alert Integration**: Send notifications to Slack and other destinations on failures
- **Cost Management**: Configurable cleanup and history management


## Prerequisites

Before installing Holmes Operator, ensure you have:

- **Kubernetes cluster** (version 1.19+)
- **Helm 3** installed
- **Existing HolmesGPT deployment** - The operator requires a running Holmes API service. If you haven't installed Holmes yet, see the [Helm Chart installation guide](../installation/kubernetes-installation.md)
- **kubectl** configured to access your cluster
- **Supported AI Provider** configured (see [AI Providers](../ai-providers/index.md))

!!! info "RBAC Permissions"

    The Holmes Operator automatically creates a ServiceAccount with the necessary permissions to manage HealthCheck and ScheduledHealthCheck resources and access the Holmes API service.

## Installation

### 1. Update Helm Values

Add the operator configuration to your existing `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
# values.yaml
operator:
  enabled: true  # Enable the operator deployment

  # Optional: Customize operator settings
  holmesApiTimeout: 300  # API timeout in seconds
  maxHistoryItems: 10  # History entries per ScheduledHealthCheck

  # Optional: Resource limits
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 256Mi
      cpu: 100m
    limits:
      memory: 512Mi
```

For a complete list of configuration options, see the [Configuration](configuration.md) page.

### 2. Install or Upgrade Holmes with Operator

If this is a new installation:

```bash
helm install holmesgpt robusta/holmes -f values.yaml
```

If upgrading an existing installation:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade holmesgpt robusta/holmes -f values.yaml
```

### 3. Verify Installation

Check that the operator pod is running:

```bash
# Check operator deployment
kubectl get deployment -l app.kubernetes.io/name=holmes-operator

# Check operator pod status
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=holmes-operator

# View operator logs
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=holmes-operator --tail=50
```

Verify that the CRDs are installed:

```bash
# List Holmes CRDs
kubectl get crd | grep holmesgpt.dev

# Should show:
# healthchecks.holmesgpt.dev
# scheduledhealthchecks.holmesgpt.dev
```

You can also verify the CRD details:

```bash
# View HealthCheck CRD
kubectl get crd healthchecks.holmesgpt.dev

# View ScheduledHealthCheck CRD
kubectl get crd scheduledhealthchecks.holmesgpt.dev
```

## Quick Start

Now that the operator is installed, you can create your first health check:

### Create a Simple Health Check

```yaml
apiVersion: holmesgpt.dev/v1alpha1
kind: HealthCheck
metadata:
  name: example-check
  namespace: default
spec:
  query: "Is the default namespace healthy? Check pod status, recent restarts, and warning events."
  timeout: 30
```

Apply it and check the results:

```bash
# Create the health check
kubectl apply -f healthcheck.yaml

# Check status (short name: hc)
kubectl get hc

# View detailed results
kubectl describe hc example-check
```

## Architecture

The Holmes Operator follows the Kubernetes Job/CronJob pattern:

- **HealthCheck**: One-time execution (like a Job)
- **ScheduledHealthCheck**: Creates HealthCheck resources on a schedule (like a CronJob)
- **Operator**: Watches CRDs and orchestrates check execution
- **Holmes API**: Executes the actual health check logic using LLM

The operator uses a distributed architecture: a lightweight kopf-based controller handles CRD orchestration and scheduling, while stateless Holmes API servers execute the actual checks.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Job/CronJob pattern**: Separate HealthCheck and ScheduledHealthCheck CRDs provide clear semantics — one-time checks give immediate feedback, scheduled checks manage recurrence. This mirrors the familiar Kubernetes Job/CronJob model.
- **Distributed operator + API servers**: The operator is a lightweight controller that delegates check execution to stateless Holmes API servers via HTTP. This allows API servers to scale horizontally and isolates scheduling concerns from execution.
- **APScheduler over CronJobs**: Scheduling uses APScheduler within the operator rather than Kubernetes CronJobs. This is more efficient for frequent checks and avoids pod startup overhead per execution.
- **HealthCheck resources as history**: ScheduledHealthCheck creates HealthCheck resources for each run, providing a natural audit trail queryable with standard kubectl commands.
